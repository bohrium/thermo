Todo: 

    --- test "energy equilibriation time ~ (nb particles * (delta volume)/volume)^3" law
        --- make sure to initialize with uniform angle momenta 
        --- wrap simulation in outer loop (with parameterized inner loop) 
        --- implement chi squared statistic for distributions
        --- analytic predictions for speed distribution
        --- average over a few timesteps to get more precise speed distribution??

    --- measure other equilibriation times
        --- analytic predictions for nearest neighbor distribution
        --- use kd structure to measure nearest neighbor distribution
